An extremly simple web server that runs on Raspberry Pi Pico W. It displays on/off buttons to control a connected LED.
It also shows Voltage and Temperature from the sensor built into the Pico W. The code mostly follows the tutorial from the book: 
"Programming The Raspberry Pi Pico/W In C" 2nd edition by Harry Fairhead.
